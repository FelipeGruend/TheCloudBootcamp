# Step 1: Use Claude to Generate Terraform Code

1. Start a conversation with Claude.
2. Ask Claude to create Terraform code for an S3 bucket. Use a prompt like:
"Please provide Terraform code to create an S3 bucket in AWS with a unique name in the us-east-1 region."
3. Claude should generate code similar to this:
    
    ```
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with the desired region
    }
    
    resource "random_id" "bucket_suffix" {
      byte_length = 8
    }
    
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
      bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
    
      tags = {
        Name        = "My bucket"
        Environment = "Dev"
      }
    }
    ```
    
4. Save this code for use in Step 5.

## Step 2: Create an IAM Role for EC2

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM dashboard.
3. Click "Roles" in the left sidebar and then "Create role".
4. Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity type and "EC2" as the use case.
5. Search for and attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy.
Note: In a production environment, use a more restrictive policy.
6. Name the role "EC2Admin" and provide a description.
7. Review and create the role.

## Step 3: Launch an EC2 Instance

1. Go to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click "Launch Instance".
3. Choose an Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
4. Select a t2.micro instance type.
5. Configure the instance details:
    - Network: Default VPC
    - Subnet: Any available
    - Auto-assign Public IP: Enable
    - IAM role: Select "EC2Admin"
6. Keep the default storage settings.
7. Add a tag: Key="Name", Value="workstation".
8. Create a security group allowing SSH access from your IP.
9. Review and launch, selecting or creating a key pair.

## Step 4: Connect to the EC2 Instance and Install Terraform

1. In the EC2 dashboard, select your "workstation" instance.
2. Click "Connect" and use the "EC2 Instance Connect" method.
3. In the browser-based SSH session, update the system packages:
    
    ```
    sudo yum update -y
    
    ```
    
4. Install yum-utils:
    
    ```
    sudo yum install -y yum-utils
    
    ```
    
5. Add the HashiCorp repository:
    
    ```
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
    
    ```
    
6. Install Terraform:
    
    ```
    sudo yum -y install terraform
    
    ```
    
7. Verify the installation:
    
    ```
    terraform version
    
    ```
    

## Step 5: Apply the Terraform Configuration

1. Create a new directory and navigate to it:
    
    ```
    mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project
    
    ```
    
2. Create and open the [main.tf](http://main.tf/) file:
    
    ```
    nano main.tf
    
    ```
    
3. Paste the Terraform code generated by Claude in Step 1.
4. Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
5. Initialize Terraform:
    
    ```
    terraform init
    
    ```
    
6. Review the plan:
    
    ```
    terraform plan
    
    ```
    
7. Apply the configuration:
    
    ```
    terraform apply
    
    ```
    
8. Type "yes" when prompted to create the resources.

## Step 6: Verify the S3 Bucket Creation

1. Use the AWS CLI to list the buckets:
    
    ```
    aws s3 ls
    
    ```
    
2. Verify that your new bucket is in the list.

## Step 7: Cleanup

1. To delete the created resources:
    
    ```
    terraform destroy
    
    ```
    
2. Type "yes" when prompted to destroy the resources.

Congratulations! You successfully used Claude to generate Terraform code, set up an EC2 workstation, installed Terraform, and created an S3 bucket. This completes Day 1 of the MultiCloud DevOps & AI Challenge.
